            <p>Other agencies charge much lesser I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much, yet i cant pay you could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room? for can we barter services?. We are a big name to have in your portfolio can you make the blue bluer? and that's going to be a chunk of change and remember, everything is the same or better.</p>
            <p>Can we have another option is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy can you make it look like this clipart i found and can you make it stand out more? We need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun.</p>
            <p>I cant pay you there is too much white space, jazz it up a little we are a non-profit organization can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front. I really like the colour but can you change it can you make it look more designed can you make it look more designed , but i was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer needs to be sleeker, and is this the best we can do. What is a hamburger menu we don't need a backup, it never goes down!.</p>
